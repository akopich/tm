There is no conventional way to define how many iteration should be performed. One of the common way to do that is to execute a fixed number of
iterations, where the number of iteration is a some heuristic. There are other stopping criterion, thus we allow user to implement his own
criterion. Any criterion should inherit criterion \texttt{trait StoppingCriteria}. Stopping criterion decides to stop based on perplexity after this iteration, perplexity after
previous iteration, number of iterations and internal state.
