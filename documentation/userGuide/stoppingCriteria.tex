There is no conventional way to define how many iteration should be executed. One of the common way to do that is to execute a fixed number of
iterations, where the number of iteration is a some heuristic. There are another stopping criterion, thus we allow user to implement his own
criterion. Any criterion should inherit trait StoppingCriteria. Stopping criterion decide to stop based on perplexity after this iteration, perplexity after
previous iteration, number of iterations and internal state.
