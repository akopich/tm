One document often corresponds to only a few topics, not to everyone. Analogously,
word corresponds only to a few topics, not to every topic. Thus some weights in
matrices $\Phi$ and $\Theta$ may be replaced by zero without drop of quality of our model. For this purpose we use
sparsifier. Any sparsifier should inherit from trait Sparsifier and implement a method apply. This method takes into input
MatrixForSparsifier and numberOfIteration. Sparsifier may obtain probabilities from matrix and decide which cells should be replaced
by zero, based on value, number of iteration and its state. To replace $i$\--th row and $j$\--th column by zero one should call\\
\texttt{matrix.setZero(i, j)}\\

\subsection*{Implemented sparsifier}
    We implement
    \begin{itemize}
	\item ZeroSparsifier, it does nothing. If you don't want to use sparsifier you should use this one. 
	\item ThresholdSparsifier \-- this class replaces value with zero if it is less than threshold if it did not replaced in this way more than \texttt{maxNumberOfZeroised} during this method call and the current number of iteration exceeds \texttt{startIteration}.
    \end{itemize}
