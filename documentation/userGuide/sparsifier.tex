One document often corresponds to only a few topics, not to every. Analogously,
word may corresponds only to a few topics, not to every topic. Thus some weights in
matrices $\Phi$ and $\Theta$ may be replaced by zero without drop of quality of our model. For this aim we use
sparsifier. Any sparsifier should inherit from trait Sparsifier and implement a method apply. This method take into input
MatrixForSparsifier, numberOfIteration. Sparsifier may obtain probabilities from matrix and decide which cells should be replaced
by zero, based on value, number of iteration and internal state. To replace $i$\--th row and $j$\--th column by zero one should call\\
\texttt{matrix.setZero(i, j)}\\

\subsection{Implemented sparsifier}
    We implement
    \begin{itemize}
	\item ZeroSparsifier, it do nothing. If you don't want to use sparsifier you should use this one. 
	\item ThresholdSparsifier \-- it class replace value by zero if it less than threshold, but not more than maxNumberOfZeroised by an iteration
	    and only after startIteration.
    \end{itemize}
